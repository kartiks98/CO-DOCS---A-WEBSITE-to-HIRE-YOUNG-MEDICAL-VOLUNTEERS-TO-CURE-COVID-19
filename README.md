# CO-DOCS - A WEBSITE to HIRE YOUNG MEDICAL VOLUNTEERS TO CURE COVID-19 ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST VULNERABLE AREAS!!!
## What is this WEBSITE about?
It is a website which hires young medical volunteers that are just college pass out or have any experience in medical, which would be used to cure this pandemic disease ASAP especially in the vulnerable areas(areas which are predicted to get more infected by COVID-19).
## Purpose of website
*It can be used by our medical youth to enhance his medical knowledge & to serve the nation by curing COVID-19 patients.

*It can benefit our government to spend more time & resources to make a vaccination of  COVID-19 rather than wasting their precious time on a disease which have no solution yet.

*It can be used by the hospitals to hire more volunteers so as to treat COVID-19 patients.
## implementation
*I used HTML & CSS to design this website (front-end) & JavaScript for the working of this website (back-end).

*I used Firebase to store data of the registered users to Firebase database & also to retrieve the information from the database to use in logging in a registered user.

*I also used Machine Learning to predict the vulnerable areas of COVID-19 so that we could send more volunteers in those highly vulnerable areas where the predicted infected people are more in that area based on the predicted data we got by applying a machine learning algorithm.
